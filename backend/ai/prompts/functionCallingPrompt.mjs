- If you're missing crucial information, use LLMDidNotUnderstand to ask the user for more details.
- Always prioritize user privacy and data security in your responses and actions.
- Never share or use information that isn't directly provided in the user data.
- Derive the user's intent from the most recent messages in the chat history.
- Pay special attention to the last user message, but also consider the context provided by earlier messages if relevant.

You are an AI assistant named Meddy tasked with transcribing and summarizing the most recent doctor's appointment from the chat history. The chat history will contain transcribed conversations, which may include one or more doctor's appointments. Your task is to identify the most recent appointment, create a transcript, and provide a summary.

Important considerations:
1. The transcription in the chat history may be incomplete or unclear in some parts. Indicate such instances in your transcript.
2. There might be multiple appointments in the chat history. Focus on the most recent one.
3. Use context clues to determine the start and end of the appointment.
4. If parts of the conversation are missing or unclear, mention this in your thoughts.

Good morning! How have you been feeling since our last appointment? Overall, I've been feeling better, but I still have some concerns about my energy levels. I've also been experiencing some in my lower back. I see. Let's start with your energy levels. Can you describe what you mean by low energy? Is it constant fatigue or does it fluctuate throughout the day? It's more of a constant tiredness. I feel like I'm dragging myself through the day, even after a full night's sleep. It's been affecting my work and my ability to exercise. Hmm, I understand. And how long has this been going on? It's been about two months now. At first, I thought it was just stress from work, but it hasn't improved even though things have calmed down at the office. Okay, thank you for that information. Now, let's take a look at your recent blood test results. Your iron levels are a bit low, which could explain the fatigue. Your vitamin D levels are also on the lower end of normal. Oh, I see. Is there anything I can do about that? Yes, there are a few things we can try. First, I'd recommend increasing your intake of iron-rich foods like spinach, lean red meat, and beans. Also, it's important to pair these with vitamin C-rich foods to improve absorption. For vitamin D, try to get about 15 minutes of direct sunlight each day, if possible. That makes sense. Any other recommendations? Yes, I'd also like you to increase your daily water intake. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day. Proper hydration can significantly impact your energy levels. Additionally, how's your sleep quality? To be honest, it's not great. I often wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep. consider some sleep hygiene practices. Try to establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens for at least an hour before bed, and create a relaxing bedtime routine. Okay, I'll definitely work on that. Should I be taking any supplements? Let's hold off on supplements for now and see how you respond to the dietary changes and sleep improvements. We'll reassess in a follow-up appointment. Speaking of which, let's schedule that for three weeks from now. Sounds good. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Yes, I'd like you to keep a food and energy journal. Note what you eat and your energy levels throughout the day. This will help us identify any patterns. Also, try to incorporate some light exercise, like a 15-minute walk each day. Alright, I can do that. Now, about the pain in my lower back... Yes, let's address that. Can you describe the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or more of an ache? It's more of a dull ache, but it gets worse when I sit for long periods. I see. How long have you been experiencing this pain? It started about three weeks ago. I thought it would go away on its own, but it's been persistent. Okay. Have you made any changes to your routine or had any injuries recently? Not really. I've been working from home more, but that's been going on for a while now. Alright. Based on what you've described, it sounds like it could be related to poor posture or extended periods of sitting. Let's do a quick physical examination. Can you lean forward for me? Now, try to touch your toes. Does this increase the pain? A little bit, yes. Okay, now lean back slightly. How does that feel? That's more uncomfortable. Alright, thank you. From what I can see and what you've described, it seems like you might be dealing with some lower back strain. This is common, especially with increased sedentary time. Is it serious? Do I need any tests? It doesn't appear to be serious at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. I don't think we need any imaging tests right now, but if the pain persists or worsens, we may consider an X-ray or MRI in the future. So, what can I do about it? I'm going to recommend some stretches and exercises that can help strengthen your core and lower back muscles. It's important to do these regularly, even when you're not experiencing pain. and make sure to take breaks from sitting every hour or so. Stand up, walk around, or do some simple stretches at your desk. Okay, I can do that. Should I use heat or ice for the pain? Good question. For this type of pain, heat is generally more beneficial. Try using a heating pad for about 15-20 minutes at a time, a few times a day. This can help relax the muscles and increase blood flow to the area. Got it. Is it okay to take pain medication? Yes, you can take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen if needed. But don't rely on them too heavily – they should be a short-term solution while you work on strengthening and improving your posture. Alright, thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing? Yes, let's talk about your work setup. Since you mentioned working from home more, it's crucial to ensure your workspace is ergonomically correct. Make sure your computer screen is at eye level, your chair supports your lower back, and your feet can rest flat on the floor. That's helpful. I'll definitely make those adjustments. Great. Now, let's circle back to your overall health. How have you been managing stress lately? Oh, sorry. I was saying that stress has been a bit of an issue lately. Work has been demanding, and I've been worried about my health. I understand. Stress can certainly exacerbate physical symptoms and affect your overall well-being. Have you considered any stress-reduction techniques? Not really. Do you have any suggestions? Absolutely. There are several approaches we can consider. Mindfulness meditation can be very effective. Even just 10 minutes a day can make a significant difference. There are also apps that can guide you through the process if you're new to it. That sounds interesting. I'll give it a try. Excellent. Another option is progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body. It can be particularly helpful for managing both stress and muscle tension. Okay, I'll look into that as well. Great. Now, let's talk about your diet a bit more. Besides the iron-rich foods we discussed earlier, how would you describe your overall eating habits? try to eat healthy, but I admit I've been relying on convenience foods more often lately. I see. While convenience foods can be tempting, especially when we're busy or stressed, they often lack the nutrients our bodies need. Let's work on incorporating more whole foods into your diet. Do you have any specific recommendations? Yes, try to include a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables in your meals. Aim for at least five servings a day. Whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats are also important. Consider meal prepping on weekends to make it easier to eat well during busy weekdays. That's helpful. I'll try to plan my meals better. Excellent. Now, let's schedule that follow-up appointment. How does three weeks from today work for you? That should be fine. Same time? Yes, let's keep it at the same time. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the office. Okay, I will. Thank you for your time and advice. You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you in three weeks. chicken butter sauce`;
