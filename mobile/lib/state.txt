state consist of:
 user object - gotten from firebase
 chat history - get using /api/chat from the server or init with empty []
 audioResponses - init as {}
 
 textInput - init as ""
 waitingForChatResponse - init as false
 isListening - init as false. 
    if going from false to true, start sending the server audio chunks
    if going from true to false send the server end of audio message and play response audio


pretty simple so we dont need a state management library
